# croutweb.neocities.org from January of 2025.
bigger and better than the original, as it is seperated into certain folders and such to keep everything where I need it most.
neocities has brought joy to my life.
by the time it's febuary, this will be outdated, but here is a list of things i would like to add to my site in the near-future:

- searching system, so you can find non-secret pages easily!
- webgames, because boredom leads to wonders!
- some kind of forums?
- videos and music
- a way to donate to me for these changes to take effect!!!!!!!!!!! (dont worry about it being a "scam", all money donated will either go to paying for neocities supporter tier or suicide prevention funding.)
